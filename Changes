        - Fix test application to call $c->forward('View::JSON') rather than
          (the incorrect) $c->forward('MyApp::View::JSON')

        - Turn off the regex fallback behavior in the test applications on
          newer Catalyst versions to ensure tests are correctly forwarding.

          classes to avoid deprecation warnings on newer Catalyst releases.
